# Spin Win Web Game

This project is a simple slot machine game implemented as a web application. Users can deposit money, place bets on spinning reels, and win money based on the symbols that appear on the reels. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and engaging user experience.

2. **Place Bets**: Users can place bets on spinning the reels.
3. **Spin the Reels**: The slot machine reels spin to randomly generate symbols.
4. **Check Winnings**: The game checks for winning combinations and updates the user's balance accordingly.
5. **Play Again**: Users can choose to play multiple rounds as long as they have a balance.
6. **Reset Game**: Users can reset the game to its initial state.
